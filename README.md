# matchrate
This research is to examine the rate at which we are matching patients to clinical trials and point out why we are not matching more. I hypothesize that we have a significant patient fallout due to the patient not being in the radius of the trial location. This can pose a serious problem, by preventing those of lower economic status not getting into trials due to location.
